This is a Retrieval Augmented Generation tutorial built for The Knowledge House students. I was brought in to teach an expert class on RAG Systems due to my experience implementing them for The Knowledge House. For the class I built lesson slides along with this jupyter notebook tutorial to re-inforce key concepts in a step by step manner to the students.
